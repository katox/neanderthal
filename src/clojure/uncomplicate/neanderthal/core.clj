    uncomplicate.neanderthal.core
  "Contains core type-agnostic linear algebraic functions roughly corresponding to functionality
  defined in BLAS 123, and functions to create and work with various kinds of vectors and matrices.
  Typically, you would want to require this namespace regardless of the actual type
  (real, complex, CPU, GPU, pure Java etc.) of the vectors and matrices that you use.

  In cases when you need to repeatedly call a function from this namespace that accesses
  individual entries, and the entries are primitive, it is better to use a primitive version
  of the function from [[uncomplicate.neanderthal.real]] namespace. Constructor functions
  for different specialized types (native, GPU, pure java) are in respective specialized namespaces
  ([[uncomplicate.neanderthal.native]], [[uncomplicate.neanderthal.opencl]], etc).

  Please take care to only use vectors and matrices of the same type in one call of a
  linear algebra operation. Compute operations typically (and on purpose!) do not support arguments
  of mixed types. For example, you can not call the [[dot]] function with one double vector (dv) and
  one float vector (fv), or for one vector in the CPU memory and one in the GPU memory.
  If you try to do bthat, an `ex-info` is thrown. You can use those different types side-by-side
  and transfer data between them though.

  ### How to use

      (ns test
        (:require [uncomplicate.neanderthal core native]))

      (ns test
        (:require [uncomplicate.neanderthal core native opencl]))
